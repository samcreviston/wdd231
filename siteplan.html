    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to store and present adventure content for Dungeon Masters (DMs) guiding players in Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). This embraces not only the playing of a fun social game, but simplifies the effort of creating content, making more time for people to come together and have fun.</p>
    <!-- e.g. The purpose of this website is to present information regarding our service-products related to white water rafting in order to build revenue for the business. -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> The audience of this website are DMs, aspiring, beginning, and experienced alike. These DMs are likely busy in their life and don't have all the time in the world to create a whole fantasy world for their groups of 2+ (2-5 on average) players. These are commonly young and middle aged men.</p>
    <!-- e.g. The audience of this website is groups. The Individuals making the reservations for the group rafting trips would be trip planners, a business team executive, youth leaders, etc. These individuals are likely between 25 and 55 years of age. They would be looking for group discounts, teamwork exercises, and instructors for groups. -->

    <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <p>Where do I find quick references to monsters and NPCs?</p>

    <p>What is the best way to run a one-shot?</p>
    <p>What is a good campaign for a small group (2-3 players)?</p>

        Fhen is the city of innovation and flight; with spires for building and nests for homes, flight is a necessary ability! However, the many visitors to the city has prompted merchants to hire Arakocra (Bird People), Griffins, and others to provide vertical transportation.
